Write a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node

Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_left(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
Where parent is a pointer to the node to insert the left-child in
And value is the value to store in the new node
Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
If parent already has a left-child, the new node must take its place, and the old left-child must be set as the left-child of the new node.
